In the real world, we can find many objects around us like cars, buildings, and humans. 
All these objects have some state and behavior. If we consider a car, then its states are name, speed, and fuel, and the behavior is refuel, drive, and park.

Classes are the building blocks of programs built using the object-oriented methodology. Such programs consist of independent self-managing modules and their interactions.

An object is an instance of a module, and a class is its definition.

Fields#
These are also known as the member variables of a class. This is because they contain the information relevant to the object of the class. 
A car object would have a top speed, a certain number of seats, and so many other pieces of data that we could store in variables.

Methods#
This category of attributes enables the class object to perform operations using the fields. 
In the case of the car class, the refuel() function would fill up the fuelCapacity property of the object.

Benefits of using classes#

The concept of classes allows us to create complex objects and applications in Java. This is why classes are the basic building blocks behind all of the OOPâ€™s principles.

Classes are also very useful in compartmentalizing the code of an application. Different components could become separate classes which would interact through interfaces. These ready-made components will also be available for use in future applications.

The use of classes makes it easier to maintain the different parts of an application since it is easier to make changes in classes.
