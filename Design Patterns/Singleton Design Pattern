It is a creational design pattern.
It ensures that a class should have only one instance throughout the application.
The instance is accessible from any part of the application with global access.

Why do we need single instance of some objects?

>There might be some objects that  may be common to all part of the program and we requires a single instance of it.
>for eg: there is a cost estimator system in a company which takes estimated cost from every department of the comapny so that the expenditure of company can be tracked.
cost estimator is a class and its object must be common in all departments so that the expenditure can be submitted to single object.

so the object to which all departments report should have global access so that all departments can access it.

here we need a Singleton Design

approch one:

define the object in a global space

public class CostEstimator{
    public CostEstimator(){}
//rest part of the class
}

CostEstimator ce = new CostEstimator();
//declared in global scope

void department1(){//uses gloalcost}
void department2(){//uses gloalcost}

drawbacks ::
this approach does not tell us that there will be only one instance of cost extimator, there can be a part of code that can call the constructor of class
(CostEstimator ce = new CostEstimator();), constructor of any class always return a new instance of that class.


public class CostEstimator{
    public CostEstimator(){}
//rest part of the class
}

CostEstimator ce = new CostEstimator();
//declared in global scope

void department1(){
CostEstimator ce = new CostEstimator();
}
void department2(){//uses gloalcost}



Efficient approach usng singleton pattern ::

>make class constructor private so no other depatment can create the another instance of the class.
>make a static variable named Cost of the class type for eg: "CostEstimator Cost ;" .
>make a static function getCost() which will return the code as well maintain the single instance creation for the class.


public static class CostEstimator{

private int amount;
private static CostEstimator Cost = null;
private CostEstimator (){
    this.amount = 0;
    }
public static CostEstimator getCost() {

    if(Cost == null){
    Cost = new CostEstimator();
    }
    //Notice that we've implemented lazy initialization
    return Cost;
}

public int showAmount (){
    return amount;
}

public void addAmount (int amount){
    this.amount += amount;
}

}


Lazy initialization --> the object is not created untill it is needed for the first time.
Early initialization --> the object is initialized at the time of declaration it self.
